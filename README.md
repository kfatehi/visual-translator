This PoC is for Persian (Farsi) language document exploration.

The main feature is that you can upload an image (e.g. a screenshot or using your phone's camera) and then draw around words or sentences. These croppings are sent to the server where Tesseract performs optical character recognition and then it is translated using Argos Translate.
